After trading every summer for 16 years my wife has finally convinced me   to sell in May and go away. I'm not sure how it will go since I'm a day   trader and like the excitement.</p>
              <p class="vjs-menu-content">I would like to leave a testimonial and you have my permission to use it if you would like.</p>
              <p class="vjs-menu-content">I have traded in dozens of trading rooms for over 16 years and I want   to relay to others that in my experience John Person is head and   shoulders above the rest. The trading system that John has developed   works beautifully day in and out in any time frame. Furthermore, John's   insights to events unfolding in real time as well as his wealth of   experience in the markets will give you an edge. Trading is difficult   these days but with a real pro in your corner, you will have an   advantage over others. Sincerely, Peter B.</p>

              <p class="vjs-menu-content">A quick note to let you know that I am closing out   the best two week stretch in my long trading career, and the credit goes   to you.<br />
  Your market sense and insight kept me on the right side of the market   and in numerous successful trades.&nbsp; My biggest obstacle in trading has   always been&nbsp;being torn between my long term analysis getting clouded by   the short term noise.&nbsp; You have helped me through this process and I am   grateful. I can't express enough my gratitude for all the hard work you   do on behalf of your clients.&nbsp; I know you have mentioned that this work   is something that you do for yourself, but sharing it with us on such a   timely basis is incredibly helpful and appreciated. Between the tweets,   e-mails, advice in your trading room, and of most importance to me, the   weekly market thoughts and observations.&nbsp; I spend Sunday afternoon doing   my homework for the week, and it is very enlightening to get your   thoughts to help in this process. Thanks, and Happy Birthday on   Saturday.&nbsp; Cheers, John Z.</p>

              <p class="vjs-menu-content">7/9/2015- Dear John and Mary, ...Personally, I   started trading full time about a year ago. Up until that point, my own   market involvement was limited to longer term holdings because I had   been told by the ...... that trading was a sucker&rsquo;s game&hellip;and I believed   them. However, as time went on, I became so infatuated with the markets,   active trading was an inevitable occurrence in my own life. First I   started swing trading stocks&hellip;then day trading stocks&hellip;then day trading   index futures, swing trading options and the list goes on and on. I read   everything that I could get my hands on (I have a collection of about   25 books), researching until all hours of the morning, and hoping that   it would all come together. But it did not. I kept losing money; A LOT   of money. After only seven months, I started looking at law schools   because at that point in time, the ......... were right.</p>
              <p class="vjs-menu-content">But then, I stumbled across John on YouTube. I came to the site and   became very interested with the services that John provides. I kept   eyeing his TTU course while looking for any feedback on it. There was   none to be found. I took a leap of faith and decided that I would give   this trading thing one more try, but with some help this time. Fast   forward four months later; the success that I have had has been nothing   less than remarkable. I have come further and faster (mind you) than I   ever thought was possible. I have almost fully recovered all prior   capital losses, been consistently profitable over the last ten weeks,   and perhaps most importantly, absolutely love trading again.</p>
              <p class="vjs-menu-content">In closing, if you are considering taking a course from John, I   strongly encourage you to do so. I am not going to lie and say that John   is perfect (he is pretty close though), or I only trade his methods&hellip;but   what I will say is that John personally gave me a strong foundation in   which to build my own methods on. If you are lost as a trader, John will   be able to help you. But&hellip;in full disclosure, it will not be easy. You   will need to put in the long nights and early mornings learning,   researching, analyzing, perfecting, and back testing. Because, even   though John throws out great trades in the trading room or twitter,   isn&rsquo;t the idea to be able to find them yourself?&nbsp; Again, thank you John   &amp; Mary! I owe all my success to the two of you.</p>

              <p class="vjs-menu-content disclaimer disclaimer style35">Hello Mary, I have been following John Person since   early 2010.&nbsp; Over the years, I have studied many market professionals,   but have found none to be of the same caliber as John. John is a   consummate professional who is happy to share his knowledge with those   willing to put forward the effort to learn trading through his   teachings.</p>
              <p class="vjs-menu-content disclaimer disclaimer style35">Some of the key things I have learned from John is patience, and a   method of trading that works for my style of trading. John&rsquo;s teaching is   so broad, that it allows one to find a style of trading that works best   for each individual which is imperative to trade successfully.&nbsp; For so   many years I had looked for an individual I could follow, and instigate   trades just as he, or she did without a lot of thought on my part.&nbsp; John   has&nbsp;taught me that this is not only&nbsp;an act of&nbsp;folly, but can lead to   questioning what one is doing, and at best stop trading, or at worse,   blow up an account.</p>
              <p class="vjs-menu-content disclaimer disclaimer style35">The second, and equally important aspect I have learned from John is   patience.&nbsp; I no longer feel compelled to trade all the time.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have   learned to watch the market and wait for a key set up with maximum   potential, and minimal risk.&nbsp; I no longer take impulse trades.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am   confident to wait, and then to act when the conditions are right.</p>
              <p class="vjs-menu-content disclaimer disclaimer style35">The last thing I would like to pass along is the people who surround   John.&nbsp; A measure of a persons worth can often be measured by those   around him or her.&nbsp; John seems to attract such high quality&nbsp;people, all   of who are more than happy to help and share their experiences, it truly   makes being involved in the Person family a delight. Warm Regards, John   Z</p>
