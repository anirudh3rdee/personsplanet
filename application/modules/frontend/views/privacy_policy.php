<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Privacy is of great concern to most users of the Internet, and is a critical part of an enjoyable and satisfactory user experience. We at Persons Planet are acutely aware of and sensitive to the privacy concerns of our subscribers and other visitors to our Web site. Whether you are a customer of our various products and services or a visitor to our site, we assure you that we do not collect personal information from you unless you provide it to us. You should be assured that we do not provide or sell personal information about our customers or site visitors to vendors that are not involved or affiliated with Persons Planet’s products or services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Privacy Statement applies to the PersonsPlanet.com site. Many of our subsidiaries maintain their own privacy policies that may be viewed on their Web sites. Persons Planet has a “network” of Affiliates that offer our services. We strive to provide our visitors and subscribers with the highest level of privacy possible, and therefore require that our Affiliates offer no less protection than that offered in this Privacy Statement. In addition, each of our Affiliates must meet the data protection requirements of their relevant national laws. Please note that our site contains links to other sites. Persons Planet is not responsible for the privacy practices, privacy statements, or content regarding these other sites.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Statistical Information About Your Visit</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you visit our site, our computers may automatically collect statistics about your visit. This information does not identify you personally, but rather identifies information about a visit to our site. We may monitor statistics such as how many people visit our site, the user’s IP address, which pages people visit, from which domains our visitors come and which browsers people use. We use these statistics about your visit for aggregation purposes only. These statistics are used to help us improve the performance of our Web site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Use of Cookies</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We only use “cookies” as described in this Section. A “cookie” is a piece of information that our Web site sends to your browser, which then stores this information on your system. If a cookie is used, our Web site will be able to “remember” information about you and your preferences either until you exit your current browser window (if the cookie is temporary) or until you disable or delete the cookie. Many users prefer to use cookies in order to help them navigate a Web site as seamlessly as possible. You should be aware that cookies contain no more information than you volunteer, and they are not able to “invade” your hard drive and return to the sender personal or other information from your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our uses of “cookies” are limited to the following specific situation. That situation is with respect to temporary cookies. There are two instances in which we use temporary cookies. First, if you are accessing our services through one of our online applications our Web server may automatically send your browser a temporary cookie, which is used to help your browser navigate our site. The only information contained in these temporary cookies is a direction value that lets our software determine which page to show when you hit the back button in your browser. This bit of information is erased when you close your current browser window. If you come to our site from one of our business partners, our Web server may also send your browser a temporary cookie that reflects an “origination code” for that business partner. We use this information for statistical and marketing purposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How We Use and With Whom We Share the Personal Information We Gather</strong></p>
