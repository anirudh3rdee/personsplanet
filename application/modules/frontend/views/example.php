Through our long term relationship, Tradestation has offered a full 100%  commission rebate on any new account on the purchases of our LIFETIME indicator and the Algo Optimizer.

We include a complete training manual and videos plus private webinars, on going customer service. </span></p>
              <p align="left" class="style69"><span class="lower_q_head">Q. </span><span class="question">I saw the webinar and heard you say the price was $3,297?&nbsp; Are  there more costs?</span> <span class="lower_q_head">A.</span> The price of the lifetime indicator is $3500 and the Algo system is $3997 - the discount bundle price is $6,797. VIP PUG &amp; PUG members receive an additional discount. One license per account.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style69"><span class="lower_q_head">Q.</span> <strong>Can I trade with my current broker</strong>? <span class="lower_q_head">A.</span> This product is solely available through TradeStation Securities. </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style69"><span class="lower_q_head">Q.</span> <strong>What size account wold be best to start with</strong>? <span class="lower_q_head">A.</span>The account size is dependent on the markets you are trading. We have a pre-built position size application that allows users to define position sizes by three methods in this version. The  first selection is Capital Traded it will automatically calculate and allocate  the amount of shares you wish to trade based on capital available. The second  selection function will automatically calculate and allocate the amount of  shares or positions based on risk per trade, and the third function allows you  to trade a set number of shares or positions. We advocate having proper risk  management and not to abuse the power of leverage and use full Initial margin  requirements set by the exchanges. As always, consult your broker or financial advisor for all your account needs and risk management.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style69"><span class="lower_q_head">Q.</span> <strong>Can I trade this through my IRA account</strong>? <span class="lower_q_head">A.</span>TradeStation has that option. It is always best to speak to their representative to determine what is best for your personal finances and risk. However, our Algo Optimizer is based  on both approved products as well as being able to use the Algo Optimizer as a  trade alert where you can select what stock or ETF to trade and then manually  enter your order on a discretionary basis.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style69"><span class="lower_q_head">Q.</span> <span class="question">In the past I mainly day traded ES and 6E, will this product work for those?</span> <span class="lower_q_head">A.</span> The reason it was name "Algo Optimizer" was because it allows the owner or user to optimize and maintain the integrity through time based on market conditions such as volatility changes. It works on ETFs, Stocks, Forex, and Futures, which includes the popylar day trade futures market like the "ES", "YM", "CL","GC", &amp; "6E".</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style69"><span class="lower_q_head">Q.</span>  <span class="question">Does this help me filter out trades for an option  strategy?</span> 
                <span class="lower_q_head">A.</span>&nbsp;This product in not  an option alert system like a high volume or volatility spike indicator, rather its an optimizer, it  identifies algorithm generated trade signals on Stocks, ETFS and Futures with  the feature of identifying the stop and profit targets. The individual user can  use that information and apply a directional option strategy such as a stock  replacement strategy, or a more advance and aggressive option strategy like a  ratio back spread. One could also apply no direction option writing strategies. <br>
  <br>
                <span class="lower_q_head">Q.</span> <span class="question">I would like to understand more about this new  product but have concerns if you do sell it, what happens then?</span> <span class="lower_q_head">A.</span> We  need to limit licenses due to possible acquisition &amp; to ensure integrity of  trade signals. If product is acquired then we had a total number of allowed available  licenses. &nbsp;Once you purchase this product  it is yours for lifetime. It is attached to your customer ID account number through  Tradestation. It cannot be deactivated or taken from you.</p>
              <p align="left" class="style69"><span class="lower_q_head">Q.</span> <span class="question">The webinar session said I can select long or short or both  what does that mean?</span> 
                <span class="lower_q_head">A.</span>  There is a function that allows you turn “on” or “off” the Buy or Sell signals.  As an example for markets deemed to be in a strong bullish trend mode you can  turn off the sell signal mode and take only long entry signals. </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style69"><span class="lower_q_head">Q.</span> <span class="question">I lease a system that  charges me $149.00 per month per each contract, how many positions am I allowed  to trade with this product.</span>              <span class="lower_q_head">A.</span> This is not a system. The beauty of this product it has no  restrictions on the quantity you want to trade or the markets you want to trade.  The buy and sell signals are based on my proprietary algorithms but any  strategy you develop is based on your optimization tests, which makes the  settings unique to you. Therefore you can trade as many share or positions as  your risk allows. In addition since we are not selling a “black box”  strategy on one single market based on one time frame like an end of day  trading system none of the signals will be impacted by multiple users. This  ensures both a high level of integrity on the entry of orders.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
