        	    	<p>To ensure that we remain disciplined and focused, we stick to the rules outlined in John’s trading course. Our motto is “If it isn’t broke, don’t fix it”. Many traders try to “tweak”, “enhance”, “improve”, or down right change a system that they end up losing focus and break a good thing. This room is designed to not let that happen to you. To ensure that, we need to follow certain guidelines as set forth below:</p>
            		<ol>
            			<li class="line_id">Refrain from private messages to instructors during trading hours</li>
            			<li class="line_id">If you have questions that are not pertinent to the current trade, please email the question and we will answer the question as time permits after the market close.</li>
            			<li class="line_id">During slow periods, we will review past trades and set aside times for direct questions so that your learning curve improves.</li>
            			<li class="line_id">Members need to prepare by reading the nightly market updates and pre-market commentaries</li>
            			<li class="line_id">Members are encouraged to remain focused on the specific indicators used to generate the trade rather than searching and switching to other forms of analysis mid-trade.</li>
