<p>Decades in the making, it's finally here and available to a  select few traders. If you’ve missed trades or didn’t see the signal, and didn't  exit the trade fast enough then this is the seminar for you. </p>
<p>Having the ability to act&nbsp;based  on predetermined, <strong><em><u>trust worthy signals</u></em></strong>, is what makes the  difference between a good day versus disastrous day; and that’s extremely  important to you, isn’t it? </p>
<p>With decreased market volatility as  the latest “new norm”, the trading life may have become too frantic by expecting  to make more money than the market may give has added stress to most traders  lives. Some traders are forcing trades and losing patience, you can’t take all trades  that may happen at all hours of the night, or can you?<br>
  </p>
<p>To ask why you do what you do, and how you could do it better,  reflecting on specific factors large or small can ultimately determine your  success, and your income.</p>
<p><img src="images/cubs-world-series.jpg" alt="Cubs world series" width="225" height="225" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">There is an old saying: “<strong>May your  live in interesting times</strong>”, well we certainly do. The proof is the Chicago Cubs  did win a world series, virtual reality and driverless cars are a reality, and in  trading, high frequency, Algo trading and Robo advisors are part of todays’  trading styles, but is  this a curse or a  blessing? How, what, when and where we trade has dramatically changed in just  five short years.&nbsp; Where will your trading be in the next five years?</p>
<h2 align="left"><strong>Are you...</strong></h2>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Concerned on how rising interest rates will       affect&nbsp;demands of an aging investment community needing safety? </li>
  <li>Curious to know how your portfolio will be affected       if&nbsp;fiscal policy from Washington collide with Monetary tightening       from the Fed? </li>
</ul>
<h2 align="left"><strong>And..</strong></h2>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Is there another “flash crash”&nbsp;in the works? Do       you want to know how to prepare your financial situation? </li>
  <li>What about the way to make money? Forget about option       and rate of return theories. Would you like to know how you can use       multiple Algos to execute trades and help impact your next twelve months       revenue. </li>
  <li>Are the markets now just a high stakes casino?  If so, how do you become the house? </li>
</ul>
<p>At my next and final seminar of  2019 you will have the  chance to get answers to these and many other critical matters. 
<p>I bet you’ve been wondering&nbsp;or  have already considered some of these questions: 
<ul>
  <li>Am I paying too much per trade? </li>
  <li>Do I really have the technology I need to do my best? </li>
  <li>Am I using a systematic approach to the market? </li>
  <li>Do I even have the right Algos in my trading methods?</li>
  <li>How good are you at what you do? How could I do better? </li>
  <li>All this adds up to one simple question, doesn’t it? </li>
</ul>
<h2> <strong>How can you make sure you have a better year  and greater income?</strong></h2>

<p>  John will show you how... in the first half of June 2017  anyone that traded found out that price volatility simply died. Trading ranges  diminished, buy as the two charts below shows there was a way to capitalize on  what small voality did exist. Newer videos available on our <a href="http://youtube.com/personsplanet channel" target="_blank">youtube.com/personsplanet channel</a>.</p>
<p>  Taking a small 2 contract position in the Algo system in  Gold futures generated a $5,420 profit.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/clip_image002.jpg" alt="chart2" width="820" height="600"></p>
<p align="left">  In that same two week sample period the 30 year bonds  generated a $3,375 profit. That’s only using two contract on each position.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/clip_image004.jpg" alt="chart3" width="820" height="600"></p>
<p align="left">  That same system in  the same time-period generated a stellar $4,560 net return on two contracts in  Crude Oil. </p>
