    <p><strong>Use the below step-by-step instructions for creating a watch-list of symbols that have liquid options.</strong></p>
    </div>
    <p>Create a scan filter for most active options – symbols with highest average daily options volume in the prior month :</p>
    <p>Follow these steps once/month to create a personal watch list of those symbols with highest average daily options volume in the prior month.</p>
    <p>Then you can select your personal “active options MAR2016” etc. watch list top left of Stock Hacker or Spread Hacker to ensure that any symbol found in your scan results does have high average daily options volume.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>A few days after month end, go to : <a href="http://www.cboe.com/data/historical-options-data/equity-option-volume" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a></li>
        <li>Click on date for the most recent month (for example, today you would click on 3/2016 )</li>
        <li>Open the Excel sheet and go down the list of symbols to symbol 100 or 200 (depending on how much liquidity you want/need).  Highlight those symbols and right-click — >>Copy</li>
        <li>Go to TOS platform and click on the name field at top of any watchlist — >> select Create Watch List</li>
        <li>Name your new watch list “active options MAR2016” or something similar</li>
        <li>Click on Import, then click on the Paste circle and save your new watch list</li>
        <li>HINT: now you can go to Stock Hacker and click on top right menu icon (square with lines) to Load Query, then use top left to drop in the new watch list into “Scan in” (to narrow results to only those symbols that have liquid options)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Repeat the process first week of every month.</p>
    
    <p>After you create a most active options for xx month watchlist, select your most active options watchlist at “Scan In” top left of Stock Hacker.  Add your other criteria and click on top right circle with lines to Save Query.</p>
    <p>NOTE: If you already have a saved query with your other options trading criteria, click on top right menu icon (square with lines) to Open Query then use top left “Scan In” to drop in your new most active options watchlist.  Click on top right menu icon to Save Query for ability to re-save with the new most active options watchlist.</p>
    <p>Open your saved query as a watchlist and it will keep scanning and automatically updating symbols found.</p>
